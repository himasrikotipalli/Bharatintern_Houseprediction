# Bharatintern_Houseprediction

### A Linear Regression Approach to Housing Price Prediction.
___
**DESCRIPTION** 
##### This project implements a linear regression model to predict house prices based on key factors like square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The data is loaded from a CSV file, preprocessed if necessary, and used to train and evaluate the model. The project explores the relationship between these features and house prices, providing insights into the real estate market.

**STEPS INVOLVED**
___
*Data Collection*: 

##### Obtain a dataset containing information about houses, including features like square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and corresponding prices.

*Data Preprocessing*:

##### Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, removing outliers, and encoding categorical variables if necessary.

*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: 

##### Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of variables, correlations between features, and identify any patterns or trends.

*Feature Selection*:

##### Select relevant features (square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms) that are most likely to influence house prices based on domain knowledge and EDA results.

*Splitting Data*: 

##### Split the dataset into training and testing sets to train the model on a portion of the data and evaluate its performance on unseen data.

*Model Training*: 

##### Implement a linear regression model using libraries such as scikit-learn in Python. Train the model using the training data, fitting it to learn the relationships between features and target variable (house prices).

*Model Evaluation*: 

##### Evaluate the trained model's performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), R-squared score, and visualizations like scatter plots or regression plots to assess how well the model predicts house prices.

*Prediction*:

##### Use the trained model to make predictions on the test dataset and compare predicted prices with actual prices to measure the model's accuracy and reliability.

*Fine-Tuning*:

##### Optionally, perform hyperparameter tuning or feature engineering to improve the model's performance if necessary.

*Deployment*:

##### Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it in a production environment where it can be used to predict house prices based on new input data (square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms).
